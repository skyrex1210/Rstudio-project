##Reading two datasets
```{r}

#Data set contains lot of column names which have space which can create complexity in manipulation and visualization so renaming the data set traffic columns using rename function as part of data preparation

#Combing Two datasets data.
```{r}
#Using inner join combing two datasets based on Date. 
trafficfull <- traffic %>%  inner_join(weather, by = "Date")

#Exporting the combined dataset as CSV file.

#Exploration 
```{r}

#refining Dataset
```{r}

tf <- tf %>% separate(Date,into = c("month","day","year"))
glimpse(tf)

write_csv(tf, 'S.csv')
